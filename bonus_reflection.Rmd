The "React Bonus Opportunity" allows you to earn up to ten additional bonus points based on recommended materials by the instructor; 5 points for each material reviewed. To earn these first review the material (video/article/etc).  Then write a very short summary of the material about 280 characters (tweet length - concise!); and something you learned from the material (also tweet length).
